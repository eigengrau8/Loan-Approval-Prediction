LOAN APPROVAL PREDICTION
A finance company deals in all kinds of home loans. They have a presence across all urban, semi-urban and rural areas. The customer first applies for a home loan and after that, the company validates the customer eligibility for the loan.

The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process based on customer detail provided while filling out online application forms. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others.

To automate this process, they have provided a dataset to identify the customer segments that are eligible for loan amounts so that they can specifically target these customers.

RETAIL PRICE OPTIMIZATION
Our task is to develop a model that predicts the optimal price for a product based on various factors. This prediction would enable us to make an informed decision when pricing a product, leading to maximized sales and customer satisfaction.

The dataset's diverse features like product details, order details, pricing, competition, time etc provide a comprehensive view for our price optimization task.

By analyzing this information, we aim to predict the optimal price for retail products. This would aid in making strategic pricing decisions, thereby optimizing retail prices effectively.
